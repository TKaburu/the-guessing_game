# Guessing Game

This is a simple console-based word guessing game implemented in Python. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player has to guess the letters in the word within a limited number of attempts. The game provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses, displaying the current progress and the letters guessed so far.

# How to Play
* The game will prompt you to guess a letter.
* Enter a single letter (capital or lowercase) as your guess.
* The game will inform you if the letter is correct or incorrect.
* You have a limited number of attempts (lives) to guess the word correctly.
* The game displays the current progress, indicating the correctly guessed letters and dashes for unknown letters.
* Keep guessing until you either guess the word correctly or run out of lives.

# Play Again
After the game ends, you will be asked if you want to play again. Enter 'y' for yes or 'n' for no. You can play the game multiple times without restarting the program.
